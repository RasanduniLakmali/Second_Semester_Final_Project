Project Description

The Smart Tuition Class Management System is a full-stack application designed to automate the management of physical tuition classes. It allows admins to manage students, instructors, schedules, and payments efficiently. Students can register, make payments, view attendance, class schedules, and access missed lessons. A standout feature is the **Personalized Study Planner**, which helps students automate home study time based on their class timetable, free hours, and goals.

The system uses **JWT (JSON Web Tokens)** for secure authentication and includes **email verification** for added security.
